### Background
The purpose of this website was to take an existing website and redesign it according to usability principles, as well as make it responsive / display well on different sized screens.
(This is an extension of UI/UX's Responsive Redesign assignment, which aimed to make a single screen responsive and well-designed.)

The website I chose was https://www.eastsideveterinary.com.
I chose this website because it's fairly simple but still has some design flaws, and a redesign would show how much of a difference design makes even when making particularly simple websites.

### Aesthetic Design Choices
I chose a navy blue / purplish color palette to mirror the already existing navy palette of their brand.

The main design flaw of the original website that I aimed to tackle was that there was little to no information hierarchy because paragraphs, headers, or links were placed awkwardly out of line with each other.

To address this, I used larger headers, bold font, and background color changes to make it clear which information was grouped together / where a particular section of a page began and ended. 
I kept everything in a neat column-row format to make it clear what information when with what heading, etc.
I also consolidated all links to the header bar instead of having some of them floating around the landing page.


### Technical Design Choices and Responsivity
To make the page display well on multiple different devices, I mostly kept everything in a flexbox or neat row so that they could be easily adjusted to columns and stacked when the screen became small.
The other major change was the margins - on a desktop display, it makes sense to have large margins since it often looks clunky / cramped / awkward to have text go all the way across a large screen, but on a small device such as a tablet or phone, it makes sense to economize more, so margins got much smaller.
For font size, I shrank headers so they didn't waste as much space but as for body text, I found that they actually translated well without change between the devices.s
